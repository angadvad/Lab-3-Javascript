// TASK 1
//     - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
//     - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
//     - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
//         + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
//         + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
//     - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
//         + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
//     - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
//         + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

// TASK 2
// - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
// - All instances built with Car:
//     + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
//     + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
// - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method. Add the gallons to `tank`.
// - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)`. The distance driven:
//     + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
//     + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
// - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
//     + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.
